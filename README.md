## Football Data Project

### Compare players in the browser

The comparison UI reads the matchday CSV files directly from the S3 bucket used
by `sync_matchday_stats.py`. Configure `AWS_S3_BUCKET`, `AWS_S3_PREFIX` (optional),
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` in `.env` or
`.dotenv`. Shell environment variables take precedence. IAM credentials from
the usual boto3 provider chain also work. The AWS principal needs
`s3:ListBucket` on the bucket and `s3:GetObject` on the CSV objects.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run compare_players_app.py
```

Use the sidebar to filter seasons, teams, and matchdays. Select up to ten
players and the stat columns to compare. Counting stats can be shown as totals
or per 90 minutes. Rating is averaged across matches; pass accuracy is weighted
by passes attempted where available. The comparison can be downloaded as CSV.
